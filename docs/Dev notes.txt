RaspPi splash screen is here
/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png

Thus, plymouth is already installed.

Ideas:
Use input pin to specify if probe arm is connected or not.  Use status report from grbl to see if 
clip is connected or not.  Thus:
1. Ground clip screw
2. Connect pin from pi to arm strip and read to see if arm is in place


Remove M3 from pcb2gcode output, and use our own ramp up code to turn on spindle.

Add a red "emergency stop" button to bit holder and connect it to Grbl alarm pin
